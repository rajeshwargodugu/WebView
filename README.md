# WebView MVVM Sample Project

## Overview

This project is a sample Android application that demonstrates how to use `WebView` with the `WebViewClient` and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern. The application loads a web page in a `WebView` and follows best practices for handling web content and managing application architecture using MVVM.

## Features

- Displays a web page using `WebView`.
- Manages web content loading and error handling with `WebViewClient`.
- Implements MVVM pattern to separate business logic from UI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Android Studio** (latest version recommended)
- **Android SDK** (API 21+)
- Basic knowledge of Kotlin and Android development

### Project Structure
## MVVM Pattern
- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic.
- **View**: Represents the UI components (e.g., Activity or Fragment).
- **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data and communicates with the Model.

- ### WebView Integration
  - **WebView**: Displays web content.
  - **WebViewClient**: Handles page loading, URL interception, and error handling.
  - **WebChromeClient**: Manages browser UI elements like progress bars and JavaScript dialogs.

- ### Implementation Details
  - **WebViewClient**
  - Purpose: To handle web page events such as URL loading, page start, page finish, and errors.
  - **Best Practices**:
    - **Restrict Loading Content**
      - Override shouldOverrideUrlLoading to handle or block certain URLs.
            
    - **Enable HTTPS**
      - Always use HTTPS to ensure data is encrypted between the client and server. T
      - his prevents interception and tampering of data.
            
    - **Disable JavaScript if Not Needed**
      - Only enable JavaScript if your web content requires it.
      - JavaScript can be a vector for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
            
    - **Use Content Security Policy**
      - CSP helps prevent XSS attacks by specifying allowed sources for content. 
            
    - **Handle File Access Carefully**
      - Disabling file access prevents your app from accessing local files via WebView.
            
    - **Prevent Unintended Navigation**
      - Ensure that URLs opened in WebView do not trigger unintended intents. 
      - For example, block URL schemes like mailto: or tel: unless necessary. 
        
    - **Enable Mixed Content Mode Carefully**
      - If your application needs to load both HTTP and HTTPS content, enable mixed content mode carefully.
          
    - **Limit Access to WebView APIs**
      - Careful when enabling WebView APIs and features. For example, disable geolocation if not needed.
      
    - **Other**
      - Override onPageStarted and onPageFinished to manage loading indicators.
      - Handle errors gracefully with onReceivedError.
    
    
- **Security**: Use secure URL schemes and handle mixed content carefully.
